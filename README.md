# Open Home Automation

**THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE, SEE [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) AS AN ALTERNATIVE.**

## Introduction
Nowadays everything becomes connected to the Internet and gives us a glimpse of many new possibilities. Home automation is part of it and offers many advantages for their users.
This repository is dedicated to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), an open source project with an amazing community, ESP8266 and ESP32 modules, the MQTT protocol and much more [...].

### Home Assistant
> Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. The goal of Home Assistant is to be able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control [[Home-Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant)].

### MQTT
> MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium [[mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org)].

## Content
### Requirements
Most of the examples below are using the MQTT protocol and so require to integrate MQTT into Home Assistant by defining a MQTT broker. More information can be found at the [MQTT component's page](https://home-assistant.io/components/mqtt/).

#### Stock Home Assistant
configuration.yaml :

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: 127.0.0.1
  port: 1883                      
  username: '[Redacted]'
  password: '[Redacted]'
  discovery: true                 # optional
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant # optional
```

#### Hass.io
configuration.yaml :

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: core-mosquitto
  username: '[Redacted]'
  password: '[Redacted]'
  discovery: true                 # optional
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant # optional
```

More options to connect the broker are available and described [here](https://home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker/#embedded-broker).

### Sketches for ESP8266/ESP32 modules
Lights, sensors, switches and more can be built on top of MQTT. This section contains a few examples based on MQTT and on a NodeMCU board (ESP8266/ESP32).
